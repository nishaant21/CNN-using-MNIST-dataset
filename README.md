# CNN Model for MNIST Dataset Classification

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in Python using Keras and TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.

The CNN model built here is designed to classify these images into one of the 10 digit classes (0 through 9).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
